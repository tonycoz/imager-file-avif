=head1 NAME

Imager::File::AVIF - read and write AVIF files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Imager;
  # will be loaded automatically in later versions of Imager when reading or writing
  use Imager::File::AVIF;

  my $img = Imager->new;
  $img->read(file=>"foo.avif")
    or die $img->errstr;

  # type won't be necessary if the extension is avif from Imager 1.008
  $img->write(file => "foo.avif", type => "avif")
    or die $img->errstr;

  use Imager::File::AVIF;
  # do we have the codecs needed to read and write?
  my $can_read  = Imager::File::AVIF->can_read;
  my $can_write = Imager::File::AVIF->can_write;

  # library build/runtime information
  my $codecs    = Imager::File::AVIF->codecs;
  my $libver    = Imager::File::AVIF->libversion;
  my $buildver  = Imager::File::AVIF->buildversion;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implements .avif file support for Imager.

At this point this is a very basic implementation, with limited
control over output.

=head1 TAGS

Imager::File::AVIF will use the following tags when writing to AVIF
and set them in images read from AVIF files:

=over

=item *

C<avif_timescale> - the base frame rate of the file.  This must be a
positive integer and is specified in Hz.  i.e. if this is 60 and all
frames have a duration of 1, the file will be playeed at 60 frames per
second.

This is only read from the first images and controls all frames in the
file.

Default: 1Hz.

=item *

C<avif_duration> - the number of timescale units for this frame.
i.e. if C<avif_timescale> is 60, and C<avif_duration> is 2, the frame
will be displayed for 1/30 second.  Default: 1.

=back

The following tag is set in image read from an AVIF file:

=over

=item *

C<avif_total_duration> - the total length of the image sequence in the
units controlled by C<avif_timescale>.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item can_read()

  if (Imager::File::AVIF->can_read) {
    # we can read AVIF files
  }

Tests whether the C<libavif> codec list includes any codecs capable of
reading.

=item can_write()

  if (Imager::File::AVIF->can_write) {
    # we can write AVIF files
  }

Tests whether the C<libavif> codec list includes any codecs capable of
writing.

=item buildversion()

Returns the version of the C<libavif> library Imager::File::AVIF was
built with.

  print Imager::File::AFIF->buildversion, "\n";

=item libversion()

Returns the version of the C<libavif> library Imager::File::AVIF is
linked with.  This may be different to buildversion() if C<libavif> is
dynamically linked.

  print Imager::File::AFIF->libversion, "\n";

=item codecs()

Returns the codecs C<libavif> was built with, this will look something
like:

  dav1d [dec]:0.7.1, libgav1 [dec]:0.16.1, aom [enc/dec]:v3.3.0

An entry with C<dec> is required to be able to read AVIF images, and
an entry with C<enc> is required to be able to write AVIF images.

  print Imager::File::AFIF->codecs, "\n";

=back

=head1 INSTALLATION

To install Imager::File::AVIF you need Imager installed and you need
C<libavif> installed, along with it's development headers.

Note that the C<libavif> included with Debian bullseye was not built
with a write compatible codec.
